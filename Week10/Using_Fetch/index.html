    <h2>Using_Fetch</h2>
  <h3>Using the Fetch API</h3>
  <p><strong>Fetch API</strong> provides a JavaScript interface for acessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as resquest and responses.
 * Also provide a global fetch() method that provides an easy logical way to fetch network resources.
 * Fetch() wont' reject on HTTP error status and,
    * won't send cross-origin cookies unless you set the credetials init option</p>
  
  <h4>fetch quest:</h4>
<p> to extract the JSON body content from the Response object, we use the json() method, which returns a second 
 promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON. <br>

  <p><strong>Supplying request options</strong><br
  fetch method can optionaly accept a second parameter, an init object that allows us to control a number of different settings
                                                   </p>

<p>If you only want to send credentials if the request URL is on the same origin as the calling script, add credentials: 'same-origin'.</p>



  <h3>Headers</h3>
 <p> headers interface allows us to create our own headers object via the Headers() constructor.
   a headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values:</p> 


  <h3>Guard</h3>
 <p> guard property is not exposed to the web but affects which mutation operations are allowed on the headers object<br>
 
   <strong>some guard values:</strong><br>
   <strong>none:</strong> default.
   <strong>request: </strong> guard for a headers object obtained from a request (Request.headers).<br>
   <strong>request-no-cors:</strong> guard for a headers object obtained from a request created with Request.mode no-cors.<br>
   <strong>response:</strong> guard for a headers object obtained from a response (Response.headers).<br>
   <strong>immutable: </strong>guard that renders a headers object read-only; mostly used for ServiceWorkers.
  </p>

  <h3>Response objects</he>
  <p>The most common response properties you'll use are:<br>
    <strong>Response.status </strong>— An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code.<br>
    <strong>Response.statusText</strong> — A string (default value ""), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message. Note that HTTP/2 does not support status messages.<br>
    <strong>Response.ok</strong> —  a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299 inclusive. This returns a boolean value.</p>
 


  <h3>Body</h3>
 <p> is an instance of any of these types:<br>
 * ArrayBuffer<br>
 * ArrayBufferView (Uint8Array and friends)<br>
 * Blob/File<br>
 * string<br>
 * URLSearchParams<br>
 * FormData</p>
 

<p>The Request and Response interfaces share the following methods to extract a body.
 *  These all return a promise that is eventually resolved with the actual content:<br>
 * Request.arrayBuffer() / Response.arrayBuffer()<br>
 * Request.blob() / Response.blob()<br>
 * Request.formData() / Response.formData()<br>
 * Request.json() / Response.json()<br>
  * Request.text() / Response.text()</p>



  <p><strong>Feature detection</strong><br>
  Fetch API support can be detected by checking for the existence of Headers, Request, Response or fetch() on the Window or Worker scope:</p>
