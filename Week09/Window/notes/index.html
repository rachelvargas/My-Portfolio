    <h2>The Window Object</h2>
  <h3>The Browser Object Model-BOM-</h3>
  <p>
 * is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen<br>
 * The BOM only makes sense in a browser environment, but <br>
 * they will still have a global object.<br>

  </p>

  <p><strong>Going Global</strong>
 * global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program,<br>
 * are actual properties of a global object.<br>
 *In the browser envronment, the global object is the window object, so any global variable created is actually aproperty otf the window obkect
  </p>
  

  <p><strong>parseInt()</strong> and <strong>isNAN()</strong> functions are methods of the global obeject:,<br>
window.parseInt(4.2);<br>

window.isNaN(4.2);<br>

ES6 made parseInt() and isNaN() methods of the Number object, so they can be both be called using the following code:<br>

Number.parseInt(4.2);<br>

Number.isNaN(4.2);<br>
