    <p>OOP is style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.<br>
    It is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. It has three concepts:<strong>Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance</strong>
       <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>Involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement <br>the functionality whitout the outside world needing to know its done</p>
   <h3>Polymorphism</h3> 
    <p>When various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementations</p>
    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>We can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods, then improve on its functionality by<br>
    adding new properties and methods</p>
