    <h1>Week 05 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <h3>Errors</h3>
    <p>Are usually caused by:<br>
      <strong>System Error:</strong>When there's a problem with the system or external devices with  which the program is interating<br>
    <strong>Programmer Error:</strong> When the program conatains incorrect syntax or faculty logic, it should be as simple as a typo<br>
    <strong>User Error:</strong>When the user has entered data incorrectly which the origram us unable to handle.</p>
    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p>Are errors that produce a return value that can be used by the program to deal with error</p>
    <h3>Warnings</h3>
    <p>Occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash,<br>
      but the program will continue to run after a warning</p>
    <h3>Debugging</h3>
    <p>Is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them<br>
      <strong>Debugging Tools</strong> allows us to set breakpoints in our code that will pause it at certain<br>
    points. It is very useful when trying to track down bugs</p>
