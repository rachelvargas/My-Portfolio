   <h2>CSS3 Transorms and Transitions<h2>
     <p><strong>Transform:</strong><br>
 transform property let us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew element on the page.<br>
       Its value is one or more transform functions that will be applied on the order thy're provided</p>
 <p><strong>Translation:</strong><br>
 translation functions allow to move elements left, right, up or down.
 Are similar to the behavior of position:relative; when ceclaring top and left, moving elements
 up and down of left and right aling the x and y axes. </p
 


   <h2>Scaling:</h2>
   <p>The <strong>scale(x,y)</strong>function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.<br>
 * If only one value is provided, it will be used for boththe x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio.
 * scale(x) and scale(y) functions will scale only the horizontal or only the vertical dimensions respectively.<br>
 * to delcare multiple transformations, we need to add a scale to the end of the space-sparated  list.<br>
 * Also, if we scale inline-block elements, text around it will fail to accommodate it with reflowing.<br>
 * If so , we need to adjust height, width, or font-size instead of using scale() transform</p>
 
<h2>Rotation:<h2>
  <p><strong> rotate()</strong> function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.<br>
 * generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positve(clockwise) and negative(counterclockwise)</p>


  <h2>Transitions:</h2>
 <p>allow the values of CSS prperties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
 with CSS transition property the color tansition ca be gradual.<br>
   
   <strong>steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</strong>
* 1- Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.<br>
* 2- Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.<br>
* 3- Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the 
transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, 
transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Weâ€™ll look at each of these
 and how they work shortly.<br>
 transition-property, property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned,
   with all for  all properties as default.</p>
 

<h2>Supporting Older Browsers<h2>
 <p>to support older browsers , we need to include the-webkit- prefix  for all of the transition properties:<br>
   -webkit-transition-property: -webkit-transform;</p>
   

  <p><strong>The ransition-duration Property:</strong>
 * sets how long the transition will take,<br>
 * it can be specify this either seconds, s, or milliseconds ms, <br>
 * Transition-duration: 0.2s;<br>
    * 200ms, is considered the optimum time for transitions, slower make seem the webiste slow</p>
 

<h2>he transition-timing-function Property<h2>
 <p> Lets us control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.<br>
  <strong>The most common timing functions:</strong><br>
  <strong>ease</strong>,has a slow start, then speedsup, and slowly.<br>
  <strong>linear</strong>, creates a transition that animates at a constant speed.<br>
  <strong>ease-in</strong>, creates a transition that is slow to start but gain speed, then stops abruptly.<br>
  <strong>ease-out</strong>, starts at full speed, then slows progressively as it reaches the conclusion of the transition:<br>
 (transition-timing-function: ease-out;)<br>
  <strong>ease-in-out</strong>, accelerates more sharply at the beginning.<br>
  <strong>cubic-bezier</strong> fuction, accepts four numeric parameters to better difine the timming funtcion<br>
  steps function defines the nuber of steps and the direction of either start or end.</p>
